Rapid PREreview focuses on providing the best infrastructure to request /
provide / analyze feedback (structured reviews) on _existing_ preprints relevant
to the outbreak community.

The feedback should be of use to:
1. the outbreak community (academics)
2. workers, editors, journalists (visualization etc.)

Rapid PREreview does _not_ focus on:
- coordinating research effort / data analysis / calling for research during
  emergency situations
- becoming / being a preprint server

**NOTE: this project is under active development and is currently not accepting

repository and we will remove this notice once we have processes and
documentation in place to allow people to collaborate productively.

## Development

### Dependencies

run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Redis

Be sure that redis is running on the default port (6379).
For convenience you can run: `npm run redis`.

### Database (CouchDB 2.x + Clouseau + Dreyfus)

The simplest way to get that up and running locally is to use the
`cloudant-developer` docker container. To do so follow the instruction on:
https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/cloudant-developer/

After installing docker run:

```sh
docker pull ibmcom/cloudant-developer
```

To start the container run:

```sh
docker run --detach --volume cloudant:/srv --name cloudant-developer --publish 5984:80 --hostname cloudant.dev ibmcom/cloudant-developer
```

The cloudant dashboard will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5984/dashboard.html

To restart the container after quiting Docker, run:
```sh
docker restart cloudant-developer
```

To stop the container and remove any previous one run:
```sh
docker rm `docker ps --no-trunc -aq` -f
```

To view the logs run:
```sh
docker logs cloudant-developer
```

### App

Once cloudant and redis are running run:

```sh
npm run init
```

to setup the databases.

To seed the app with some data run:

```sh
npm run seed
```

After, run:

```sh
npm start
```

and visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/)

### Storybook (components playground)

run:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

and visit [http://127.0.0.1:3030/](http://127.0.0.1:3030/).

To add stories, add a file that ends with `.stories.js` in the `./src/components` directory.


### Web extension

#### Development

For chrome:
1. Run `npm run extension:watch` that will build and watch the extension in the
   `extension` directory. ! DO NOT EDIT THE FILES THERE or do not tack them on
   git, with the exception of manifest.json, fonts, and popup.html.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, be sure to toggle the "developer mode",
   click on "load unpacked" and select the content of the `extension` directory.


#### Production

For chrome:
1. Run `npm run extension:build`
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, be sure to toggle the "developer mode",
   click on "load unpacked" and select the content of the `extension` directory.

### Tests

Once cloudant and redis are running run:

```sh
npm test
```

### Deployments

We use Azure and IBM Cloudant.

#### Architecture

TODO

#### Process

1. Install Azure CLI (see
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)
2. Run `az login` to login to the CLI
3. Get the private files not checked in to GitHub: `./get-private.sh` (if you
   later update those files, run `./put-private.sh` to upload them back)
4. Run `npm run build` (after having run `npm install`)
5. Run `./deploy-app.sh` to deploy the app and `./deploy-service.sh` to deploy the service

To see the logs, run `./log-app.sh` or `./log-service.sh`. We use
[pino](https://getpino.io/) for logging.

To seed the production database run: `npm run seed:prod`. Be aware that this
will source the production environment variables.

#### Backups
