          <dc:description>  Infectious diseases often display oscillations in the number of infected
          cases through time. Sometimes the ups and downs are caused by seasonal,
          exogenous events, such as the increase of influenza cases in winter, or the
          increase of vector-borne diseases during rainy seasons. Other times, the
          infection displays non-seasonal periodic oscillations, like syphilis, which
          oscillates with a period of 8-11 years. Several mathematical models aim to
          capture these oscillations, either by including a period in the transmission
          rate, by allowing link rewiring in contact networks, or by considering models
          with temporary immunization. Here we present a stochastic, yet analytically
          solvable, epidemic spreading model where the individuals of the population
          decide whether to take preventive measures or not depending on the global
          extent of the disease, being this an assessment of their infection risk. We
          show that the combined feedback between the human decision on prophylaxis, and
          the perceived epidemic risk, are sufficient conditions for the emergence of
          self-sustained oscillations in diseases well-described by the
          Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) compartmental model, as it is the case
          for many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Finally, we propose plausible
          mechanisms to damp out the oscillations. Our study prompts to the design of
          persistent prevention campaigns, substantiated on not only perceived but real
          risks, to improve human prophylactic behavior and contain the recently reported
          raise of STDs and the consequent re-emergence of HIV.
