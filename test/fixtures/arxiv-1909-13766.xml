          <dc:description>  Influenza forecasting in the United States (US) is complex and challenging
          for reasons including substantial spatial and temporal variability, nested
          geographic scales of forecast interest, and heterogeneous surveillance
          participation. Here we present a flexible influenza forecasting model called
          Dante, a multiscale flu forecasting model that learns rather than prescribes
          spatial, temporal, and surveillance data structure. Forecasts at the Health and
          Human Services (HHS) regional and national scales are generated as linear
          combinations of state forecasts with weights proportional to US Census
          population estimates, resulting in coherent forecasts across nested geographic
          scales. We retrospectively compare Dante's short-term and seasonal forecasts at
          the state, regional, and national scales for the 2012 through 2017 flu seasons
          in the US to the Dynamic Bayesian Model (DBM), a leading flu forecasting model.
          Dante outperformed DBM for nearly all spatial units, flu seasons, geographic
          scales, and forecasting targets. The improved performance is due to Dante
          making forecasts, especially short-term forecasts, more confidently and
          accurately than DBM, suggesting Dante's improved forecast scores will also
          translate to more useful forecasts for the public health sector. Dante
          participated in the prospective 2018/19 FluSight challenge hosted by the
          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and placed 1st in both the national
          and regional competition and the state competition. The methodology
          underpinning Dante can be used in other disease forecasting contexts where
          nested geographic scales of interest exist.
